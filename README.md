## My portfolio website

This portfolio was created during my studies at Hyper Island. Particularly for the one week course called 'The Ecosystem of Frontend'.

The objective of the course is to showcase me and my skills to potention employers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
